### Method

Follow these steps to set up and flash the firmware on your LILYGO¬Æ TTGO T-Display-S3 board:

1. Download a copy of this repository and place the `tdisplays3` folder in your ESPHome folder. Also, place the `example.yaml` and `secrets.yaml` files into the ESPHome folder, making sure to change the `example.yaml` API and `secrets.yaml` details to your own credentials.
2. From your ESPHome dashboard, create a local copy of the S3 firmware by clicking the three dots > **Install** > **Manual Download** > **Modern Format**.
3. To set the board into flash mode, hold the button on the left of the USB port while plugging in the USB cable that is connected to your desktop machine.
4. Navigate to [https://web.esphome.io/](https://web.esphome.io/) in a compatible browser (Chrome, Edge, etc.) and click **Connect**. Select the corresponding COM Port and click **Connect** again.
5. When the board has connected, click **Install** and select the firmware that you have created. This will erase the board and write the new firmware.
6. When the firmware has been written to the board, you will need to unplug and reconnect the USB cable.
7. After that, you can upload firmware updates using Wi-Fi without repeating this process.
